			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/Focus.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

			<p>Born to a merchant servicer and a teacher  Joshua F. Cassell III grew up with great communication skills and a business mindset. In 1995 his father worked on the marketing team for Anheiser Busch. Often Joshua's father threw away some outdated promotional propaganda and Joshua observed how quickly one man's trash was another man's treasure. That year a fourth grader would make his first business in selling the abundant supply of a variety of Anheiser Busch merchandise. Joshua would't stop there.</p>
			<p> Joshua majored in accounting to one day take account of his own balance sheets. Joshua has gained the experience from working as a Tax Preparer, and working with the State of New Jersey on their Account receivables all while going to school at Rutgers Camden. When Joshua switched his career to work in Mortgages he developed a passion for Real Estate. It was at this time he started to put his focus and study on wholesale properties. Joshua took time off of his studies at Rutgers and quickly formed the foundation of Essential Network Enterprise. A major element needed to complete the dream was Computer Programming. Joshua would continue his Education once again this time as a student in an intense training Bootcamp which has empowered and equipped Joshua with a valuble resource.</p>
